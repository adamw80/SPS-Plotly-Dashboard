# SPS Plotly Dashboard

A Plotly Dash web application designed to visualize and analyze synthetic patient data for a mental health clinic. This project includes a range of financial, no-show, and patient churn analyses and is deployed [here](https://portfolio-projects.fly.dev).

**Note**: The data in this project is synthetic and not real patient data, ensuring compliance with HIPAA regulations.

## Project Overview

This dashboard provides insights into various aspects of a clinicâ€™s operations, with sections dedicated to:

- **Financial Overview**: Revenue and profit breakdowns by quarter and financial forecasting.
- **No-Show Analysis**: Rates of appointment no-shows by age group, diagnosis, and improvement metrics.
- **Patient Churn Analysis**: Visualizations of patient churn trends, including diagnosis distribution, distance from the clinic, and other metrics affecting churn.

## Project Structure

- **app.py**: Main application file containing the Plotly Dash code for layout, figures, and graph configurations.
- **Dockerfile**: Configuration for containerizing the application for deployment.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies required to run the application.
- **notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data preparation and initial graph generation.
- **assets/**: Directory with the logo and any additional static resources.
